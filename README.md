### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Robotics and Intelligent Systems Engineering graduate** from **Manara University**, passionate about **Robotics**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Control Systems**.  
My mission is to bridge theory and real-world applications through intelligent robotic systems that perceive, decide, and act autonomously.

For my **undergraduate thesis**, I designed and implemented a **monocular camera-equipped differential-drive mobile robot** for **indoor 3D reconstruction**, integrating **hybrid control** and **path-tracking** approaches — combining **AI optimization**, **control theory**, and **computer vision**.

I’m currently preparing to pursue a **Master’s in Robotics & AI** to further specialize in **autonomous mobile robotics**, focusing on:
- 🗺️ Path planning & localization  
- ⚙️ Adaptive & intelligent control  
- 🧭 AI-based decision making for autonomy
